## Introduction

This document provides a mathematical framework for implementing arbitrage strategies between different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the same blockchain. As the second stage in the arbitrage learning path, this strategy builds upon the understanding of basic arbitrage principles developed in CEX-to-CEX arbitrage, while introducing key concepts specific to DEX trading such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs), liquidity pools, and gas optimization. By systematically analyzing these elements through mathematical models, this framework aims to guide the development of effective DEX-to-DEX arbitrage strategies that properly account for the unique characteristics of decentralized markets.

## AMM Pricing Mechanism Model

### Constant Product Formula

The foundation of most DEX pricing is the constant product formula:

\[
x \cdot y = k
\]

Where:
- \( x \) is the quantity of token X in the pool
- \( y \) is the quantity of token Y in the pool
- \( k \) is a constant value representing the pool's invariant

The spot price of token Y in terms of token X is:

\[
P_{Y/X} = \frac{x}{y}
\]

For a trade that adds \( \Delta x \) amount of token X and removes \( \Delta y \) amount of token Y:

\[
(x + \Delta x)(y - \Delta y) = k
\]

Solving for \( \Delta y \):

\[
\Delta y = y - \frac{k}{x + \Delta x} = y - \frac{x \cdot y}{x + \Delta x} = y \cdot \left(1 - \frac{x}{x + \Delta x}\right)
\]

### Price Impact and Slippage

The execution price after slippage for buying token Y with token X is:

\[
P_{execution} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{\Delta x}{y \cdot \left(1 - \frac{x}{x + \Delta x}\right)}
\]

The price impact percentage can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Price Impact}(\%) = \left(\frac{P_{execution} - P_{spot}}{P_{spot}}\right) \cdot 100\%
\]

For small trades relative to pool size, the price impact can be approximated linearly:

\[
\text{Price Impact}(\%) \approx \frac{\Delta x}{x} \cdot 100\%
\]

### Multi-Pool Price Path

For arbitrage involving multiple pools, the price relationship can be modeled as:

\[
P_{A/C} = P_{A/B} \cdot P_{B/C}
\]

Where tokens A, B, and C form a triangular trading path.

When this relationship is unbalanced, an arbitrage opportunity exists:

\[
P_{A/C} \neq P_{A/B} \cdot P_{B/C}
\]

The percentage difference representing the potential arbitrage profit before costs:

\[
\text{Profit Potential}(\%) = \left|\frac{P_{A/C}}{P_{A/B} \cdot P_{B/C}} - 1\right| \cdot 100\%
\]

## Arbitrage Opportunity Detection

### Price Divergence Criteria

For two DEXs offering the same token pair (X/Y), an arbitrage opportunity exists when:

\[
\frac{P_{Y/X}^{DEX1}}{P_{Y/X}^{DEX2}} > (1 + \tau)
\]

Where \( \tau \) is the threshold that accounts for fees and gas costs.

### Threshold Calculation

The threshold \( \tau \) is calculated as:

\[
\tau = \frac{f_{DEX1} + f_{DEX2} + \frac{G}{Q \cdot P_X}}{1 - f_{DEX2}}
\]

Where:
- \( f_{DEX1} \) and \( f_{DEX2} \) are the DEX fee rates
- \( G \) is the gas cost in blockchain's base currency
- \( Q \) is the trade quantity
- \( P_X \) is the price of token X in the blockchain's base currency

### Opportunity Monitoring Framework

Continuous monitoring requires calculating the price ratio:

\[
R = \frac{\max(P_{Y/X}^{DEX1}, P_{Y/X}^{DEX2})}{\min(P_{Y/X}^{DEX1}, P_{Y/X}^{DEX2})}
\]

An opportunity signal is triggered when:

\[
R > 1 + \tau
\]

## Optimal Trade Size Model

### Profit Maximization Function

The net profit function for a DEX arbitrage trade:

\[
\Pi(Q) = Q \cdot P_{Y/X}^{DEX2} \cdot (1 - f_{DEX2}) - Q \cdot P_{Y/X}^{DEX1} \cdot (1 + f_{DEX1}) - G
\]

Accounting for price impact, the function becomes:

\[
\Pi(Q) = Q \cdot P_{Y/X}^{DEX2}(Q) \cdot (1 - f_{DEX2}) - Q \cdot P_{Y/X}^{DEX1}(Q) \cdot (1 + f_{DEX1}) - G
\]

The optimal trade size that maximizes profit can be found by solving:

\[
\frac{d\Pi(Q)}{dQ} = 0
\]

### Slippage Consideration

For constant product AMMs, the price after slippage for a trade size \( Q \) in DEX1 is:

\[
P_{Y/X}^{DEX1}(Q) = \frac{x_1}{y_1} \cdot \frac{x_1 + Q \cdot (1 - f_{DEX1})}{x_1}
\]

Similarly for DEX2:

\[
P_{Y/X}^{DEX2}(Q) = \frac{x_2}{y_2} \cdot \frac{y_2}{y_2 - Q}
\]

### Gas Cost Analysis

Gas costs have significant impact on DEX arbitrage profitability. The relationship between gas price (\( G_p \)) and confirmation time (\( T \)) often follows:

\[
T \approx \alpha \cdot e^{-\beta \cdot G_p}
\]

Where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are blockchain-specific parameters.

The optimal gas price balances cost and execution time:

\[
G_p^* = \arg\min_{G_p} \{G_p \cdot G_u + \lambda \cdot T(G_p)\}
\]

Where:
- \( G_u \) is gas units used by the transaction
- \( \lambda \) is a time-value parameter

## Blockchain-Specific Optimization

### Gas Fee Structure

Different blockchains have different fee structures. For Ethereum-like blockchains:

\[
\text{Transaction Fee} = \text{Gas Used} \times \text{Gas Price}
\]

The gas price threshold for profitable arbitrage:

\[
G_p^{max} = \frac{\Pi_{before\_gas}}{G_u}
\]

### Transaction Priority Framework

Transaction priority can be modeled as:

\[
\text{Priority Score} = \frac{G_p}{G_p^{median}} + \alpha \cdot \text{Nonce Reduction} - \beta \cdot \text{Block Usage}
\]

Where parameters \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are specific to the blockchain's consensus mechanism.

### MEV Protection Strategies

To protect against Miner Extractable Value (MEV), strategies include:

1. **Private transactions**: Reducing visibility with a privacy score:
   \[
   \text{Privacy Score} = 1 - \frac{\text{Exposed Nodes}}{\text{Total Nodes}}
   \]

2. **Slippage tolerance**: Setting maximum acceptable slippage:
   \[
   \text{Slippage Tolerance} = \frac{P_{expected} - P_{min}}{P_{expected}} \cdot 100\%
   \]

## Risk Management Models

### Transaction Failure Risk

The probability of transaction failure:

\[
P_{fail} = P_{gas} \cdot P_{congestion} \cdot P_{slippage} \cdot P_{technical}
\]

Where each component represents different failure scenarios.

Expected value considering failure risk:

\[
E[\Pi] = \Pi \cdot (1 - P_{fail}) - C_{fail} \cdot P_{fail}
\]

Where \( C_{fail} \) is the cost incurred upon failure.

### Smart Contract Risk

Risk exposure to smart contract vulnerabilities:

\[
\text{Contract Risk} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \cdot L_i
\]

Where \( P_i \) is the probability of vulnerability type \( i \) and \( L_i \) is the associated loss.

### Market Movement Risk

The risk of adverse price movements during transaction confirmation:

\[
\text{Movement Risk} = \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T} \cdot z
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is price volatility
- \( T \) is confirmation time
- \( z \) is the z-score for the desired confidence level

## Comparison with CEX Arbitrage

| Factor | DEX-to-DEX Arbitrage | CEX-to-CEX Arbitrage |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Execution Speed | Slower (blockchain confirmations) | Faster (API execution) |
| Cost Structure | High (gas fees) | Low (trading fees) |
| Capital Efficiency | High (single wallet) | Lower (funds in multiple exchanges) |
| Price Impact | Higher (limited liquidity) | Lower (order book depth) |
| Market Access | Open (permissionless) | Restricted (KYC requirements) |
| Technical Complexity | Higher (blockchain interaction) | Lower (standardized APIs) |
| Risk Profile | Smart contract + market risks | Exchange counterparty + market risks |

## Implementation Guidelines

### DEX Connector Setup

Optimal connector configuration parameters:

\[
C_{optimal} = \arg\min_{C} \{w_1 \cdot T_{execution}(C) + w_2 \cdot P_{failure}(C) + w_3 \cdot C_{maintenance}\}
\]

Where weights \( w_1 \), \( w_2 \), and \( w_3 \) prioritize performance aspects.

### Blockchain Interaction

Transaction submission optimization:

\[
\text{Submission Strategy} = f(G_p, \text{Nonce}, \text{Memory Pool Congestion}, \text{Block Time Distribution})
\]

### Strategy Configuration

Key configuration parameters:
1. **Minimum profit threshold**: \( \Pi_{min} > G \cdot (1 + \text{buffer}) \)
2. **Maximum trade size**: \( Q_{max} < \min(Q_{liquidity}, Q_{wallet}) \)
3. **Gas price strategy**: Dynamic or fixed, based on \( G_p^* \) calculation
4. **DEX priority list**: Ranked by liquidity, reliability, and fee structure

## Performance Metrics

Performance evaluation metrics include:
1. **Profit per Trade**: \( \frac{\sum \Pi_i}{n} \)
2. **Success Rate**: \( \frac{\text{Successful Trades}}{\text{Total Attempted Trades}} \)
3. **Capital Efficiency**: \( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Capital Deployed}} \cdot \frac{365 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60}{\text{Time Period in Seconds}} \)
4. **Gas Efficiency**: \( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Gas Spent}} \)
5. **Risk-Adjusted Return**: Sharpe ratio adapted for blockchain arbitrage
