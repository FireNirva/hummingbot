## Introduction

This document provides a mathematical framework for implementing a strategy that combines liquidity mining with arbitrage trading. As the fourth stage in our arbitrage strategy learning path, this approach builds upon the understanding of CEX-CEX, DEX-DEX, and CEX-DEX non-transfer arbitrage, further introducing liquidity mining as an additional source of revenue. By providing liquidity on DEXs to earn mining rewards while simultaneously exploiting price fluctuations for arbitrage, this strategy aims to optimize capital utilization and achieve dual income streams. This framework systematically analyzes these elements through mathematical models, guiding the development of strategies that effectively balance liquidity provision and trading activities.

### Liquidity Mining Yield Structure

Liquidity mining returns come from three main sources:

1. **Transaction Fee Income:**
   \[
   R_{fee} = L \cdot f_{DEX} \cdot f_{LP} \cdot \frac{V_{DEX}}{L_{total}}
   \]
   where \( L_{total} \) is the total liquidity in the pool.

2. **Token Rewards:**
   \[
   R_{token} = L \cdot r_{reward} \cdot \frac{T_{LP}}{365 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60} \cdot P_{reward}
   \]

3. **Additional Incentives:**
   \[
   R_{extra} = L \cdot r_{extra} \cdot \frac{T_{LP}}{365 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60}
   \]
   
Total liquidity returns:
\[
R_{LP} = R_{fee} + R_{token} + R_{extra}
\]

Annual percentage yield:
\[
APY_{LP} = \frac{R_{LP}}{L} \cdot \frac{365 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60}{T_{LP}} \cdot 100\%
\]

### Arbitrage Opportunity Identification

In a liquidity mining environment, arbitrage opportunities arise from:

1. **Price Deviations Between DEXs:**
   Price ratio: \( R = \frac{P_{DEX1}}{P_{DEX2}} \)
   
   Opportunity condition: \( R > 1 + \tau \) or \( R < \frac{1}{1 + \tau} \)
   
   where \( \tau \) is the threshold accounting for transaction costs.

2. **Deviations Between AMM and External Prices:**
   For constant product AMMs: when \( \frac{x}{y} \neq \frac{P_B}{P_A} \), arbitrage opportunities exist

3. **Reward Token Price Fluctuations:**
   When reward token prices change significantly: \( |\frac{P_{reward}(t)}{P_{reward}(t-\Delta t)} - 1| > \delta \)
   
   where \( \delta \) is the trigger threshold.

## Dual Revenue Model

### Liquidity Provision Returns

Expected returns from liquidity provision, considering impermanent loss:

\[
E[R_{LP}] = R_{LP} - E[IL]
\]

Impermanent loss estimation:
\[
IL = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_A(t)}{P_A(0)} \cdot \frac{P_B(t)}{P_B(0)}} - \frac{P_A(t)}{P_A(0)} - \frac{P_B(t)}{P_B(0)}
\]

For a single asset price change factor \( k = \frac{P_A(t)}{P_A(0)} \), impermanent loss simplifies to:
\[
IL = 2 \cdot \sqrt{k} - k - 1
\]

### Arbitrage Trading Returns

Expected returns from arbitrage trading:
\[
E[R_{arb}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot \Pi_i - C_{trading}
\]

where:
- \( p_i \) is the probability of arbitrage opportunity i occurring
- \( \Pi_i \) is the potential profit from each arbitrage
- \( C_{trading} \) is the total trading cost

Basic arbitrage profit model:
\[
\Pi = Q \cdot (\Delta P - f_{total}) - G
\]

where \( f_{total} \) is the total transaction fee and \( G \) is the gas cost.

### Integrated Yield Optimization

Total expected return for the combined strategy:
\[
E[R_{total}] = w_{LP} \cdot E[R_{LP}] + w_{trade} \cdot E[R_{arb}]
\]

Subject to:
\[
w_{LP} + w_{trade} = 1
\]

Optimal capital allocation objective:
\[
\{w_{LP}^*, w_{trade}^*\} = \arg\max_{w_{LP}, w_{trade}} E[R_{total}]
\]

Risk-adjusted optimization objective:
\[
\{w_{LP}^*, w_{trade}^*\} = \arg\max_{w_{LP}, w_{trade}} \frac{E[R_{total}]}{\sigma_{total}}
\]

where \( \sigma_{total} \) is the total risk of the portfolio.

## Capital Allocation Framework

### Static Capital Allocation

Application of the Kelly criterion:
\[
f^* = \frac{p \cdot \frac{R}{Q} - (1-p) \cdot \frac{L}{Q}}{\frac{R}{Q}}
\]

where:
- \( p \) is the probability of profit
- \( R \) is the potential return
- \( L \) is the potential loss
- Optimal capital fraction is \( w_{optimal} = f^* \)

Portfolio optimization considering correlations:
\[
\vec{w}^* = \arg\max_{\vec{w}} \frac{\vec{w}^T \vec{\mu} - r_f}{\sqrt{\vec{w}^T \Sigma \vec{w}}}
\]

where \( \vec{\mu} \) is the expected return vector and \( \Sigma \) is the covariance matrix.

### Dynamic Capital Rebalancing

Market state-based dynamic adjustment model:
\[
w_{LP}(t) = w_{LP,base} + \Delta w_{LP}(S_t)
\]

where \( S_t \) is the current market state vector and \( \Delta w_{LP}(S_t) \) is the state-based adjustment.

Market state indicators may include:
- Price volatility: \( \sigma_P \)
- Mining yield changes: \( \Delta r_{LP} \)
- Arbitrage opportunity frequency: \( f_{arb} \)
- Trading volume trends: \( \Delta V \)

Rebalancing trigger condition:
\[
|w_{LP}(t) - w_{LP}(t-\Delta t)| > \theta_{rebalance}
\]

### Capital Efficiency Optimization

Capital efficiency measure:
\[
CE = \frac{E[R_{total}]}{C_{total}}
\]

Liquidity utilization ratio:
\[
LUR = \frac{L_{active}}{L_{total}}
\]

Optimization of active liquidity ratio:
\[
LUR^* = \arg\max_{LUR} \{E[R_{LP}(LUR)] + E[R_{arb}(LUR)]\}
\]

Recovery period:
\[
T_{recovery} = \frac{C_{setup}}{E[R_{daily}]}
\]

where \( C_{setup} \) is the initial setup cost, including gas fees.

## Risk Management Model

### Impermanent Loss Risk

Derivative of impermanent loss with respect to price changes:
\[
\frac{dIL}{dk} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} - 1
\]

Price change sensitivity:
\[
S_{IL} = \frac{\Delta IL}{\Delta k} \cdot \frac{k}{IL}
\]

Maximum tolerable impermanent loss threshold:
\[
IL_{max} = min\left(R_{LP}, \theta_{IL} \cdot C_{LP}\right)
\]

where \( \theta_{IL} \) is the capital proportion limit.

### Token Price Risk

Price volatility model:
\[
\sigma_{portfolio}^2 = w_A^2 \cdot \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \cdot \sigma_B^2 + 2 \cdot w_A \cdot w_B \cdot \rho_{AB} \cdot \sigma_A \cdot \sigma_B
\]

Price risk for reward tokens:
\[
R_{price} = Q_{reward} \cdot \sigma_{reward} \cdot \sqrt{T} \cdot z_{\alpha}
\]

where \( z_{\alpha} \) is the z-score for confidence level \( \alpha \).

Price decline protection strategy:
- Stop-loss point setting: \( P_{stop} = P_{entry} \cdot (1 - \theta_{stop}) \)
- Target price: \( P_{target} = P_{entry} \cdot (1 + \theta_{target}) \)

### Protocol Risk

Multi-dimensional risk scoring model:
\[
R_{protocol} = w_1 \cdot R_{smart contract} + w_2 \cdot R_{governance} + w_3 \cdot R_{economic} + w_4 \cdot R_{regulatory}
\]

Smart contract risk mitigation:
- Audit score: \( S_{audit} \)
- Time tested: \( T_{live} \)
- Bug bounty: \( B_{bounty} \)

Comprehensive protocol risk score:
\[
S_{protocol} = f(S_{audit}, T_{live}, B_{bounty}, ...)
\]

### Integrated Risk Adjustment

Risk-adjusted return ratio:
\[
RAR = \frac{E[R_{total}] - r_f}{\sigma_{total}}
\]

Sortino ratio considering negative skewness:
\[
Sortino = \frac{E[R_{total}] - r_f}{\sigma_{downside}}
\]

Maximum drawdown limit:
\[
MD_{max} = \theta_{drawdown} \cdot C_{total}
\]

Risk parity allocation:
\[
w_i \propto \frac{1}{\sigma_i}
\]

## Strategy Execution Optimization

### Liquidity Adding and Withdrawal Timing

Optimal liquidity entry timing:
\[
t_{entry}^* = \arg\max_t E[R_{LP}(t) - IL(t)]
\]

Optimal liquidity withdrawal decision rule:
\[
\text{Withdraw if } E[R_{LP,future}] < E[R_{alternative}] \text{ or } IL > IL_{threshold}
\]

Market condition indicators:
- Price trend: \( \mu_P \)
- Volatility trend: \( \Delta \sigma_P \)
- Mining reward changes: \( \Delta r_{reward} \)

### Reward Harvesting Frequency

Optimal harvesting frequency:
\[
f_{harvest}^* = \arg\max_f \{R_{harvest}(f) - C_{harvest}(f)\}
\]

Harvesting cost model:
\[
C_{harvest}(f) = G_{harvest} \cdot f
\]

Minimum effective harvesting threshold:
\[
R_{min} = \frac{G_{harvest}}{1 - \theta_{profit}}
\]

where \( \theta_{profit} \) is the target profit rate.

### Arbitrage Execution Thresholds

Basic arbitrage threshold:
\[
\tau = \frac{f_{total} + \frac{G}{Q \cdot P}}{1 - f_{DEX}}
\]

Liquidity-adjusted threshold:
\[
\tau_{adjusted} = \tau \cdot \left(1 + \gamma \cdot \frac{Q}{L_{pool}}\right)
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the liquidity sensitivity parameter.

Dynamic execution threshold:
\[
\tau(t) = \tau_{base} \cdot f(V_t, \sigma_t, G_t)
\]

where function \( f \) adjusts the threshold based on current trading volume \( V_t \), volatility \( \sigma_t \), and gas price \( G_t \).

## Market Impact and Strategy Adaptation

### Liquidity Depth Impact

Market impact of adding liquidity:
\[
\Delta P = P \cdot \frac{L_{add}}{L_{pool} + L_{add}}
\]

Optimal liquidity addition batches:
\[
\{L_1, L_2, ..., L_n\} = \arg\min_{L_1, L_2, ..., L_n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\Delta P_i|
\]

Subject to:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i = L_{total}
\]

### Mining Yield Variations

Yield dilution model:
\[
r_{diluted} = r_{initial} \cdot \frac{L_{initial}}{L_{initial} + \sum_{j=1}^{m} L_{new,j}}
\]

Elasticity of yield to liquidity changes:
\[
\epsilon_{r,L} = \frac{\Delta r / r}{\Delta L / L}
\]

Elasticity of yield to price changes:
\[
\epsilon_{r,P} = \frac{\Delta r / r}{\Delta P / P}
\]

### Competitive Strategy Adaptation

Strategy adaptation model:
\[
S_t = f(S_{t-1}, C_t, M_t)
\]

where:
- \( S_t \) is the current strategy state
- \( C_t \) is competitive strategy information
- \( M_t \) is market state

Game theory equilibrium analysis:
\[
\{S_A^*, S_B^*\} = \arg\max_{S_A, S_B} \{u_A(S_A, S_B), u_B(S_B, S_A)\}
\]

where \( u_A \) and \( u_B \) are strategy payoff functions.

Counter-strategy detection metrics:
- Liquidity change rate: \( \frac{\Delta L}{L \cdot \Delta t} \)
- Price impact ratio: \( \frac{\Delta P}{V} \)
- Trading pattern similarity: \( sim(T_A, T_B) \)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Protocol Selection and Parameter Configuration

Protocol selection scoring system:
\[
S_{protocol} = w_1 \cdot APY + w_2 \cdot TVL + w_3 \cdot Age - w_4 \cdot Risk
\]

Key parameter configurations:
1. **Liquidity pool selection**: Prioritize pools with \( APY > 2 \cdot APY_{benchmark} \) and \( TVL > TVL_{min} \)
2. **Capital allocation ratio**: Initial setting \( w_{LP} = 0.7, w_{trade} = 0.3 \), adjust based on actual performance
3. **Impermanent loss limit**: Set \( IL_{max} = 0.5 \cdot E[R_{LP}] \)
4. **Reward harvesting threshold**: Harvest when \( R_{harvest} > 3 \cdot G_{harvest} \)
5. **Arbitrage execution condition**: Execute when \( \Delta P\% > \tau + 2\sigma_{\tau} \)

### Monitoring System Design

Real-time monitoring metrics:
1. Pool liquidity changes: \( \frac{\Delta L_{pool}}{L_{pool}} \)
2. Price deviation level: \( |\frac{P_{DEX}}{P_{CEX}} - 1| \)
3. Mining yield trend: \( \frac{dr_{LP}}{dt} \)
4. Volume and fee trends: \( \frac{dV}{dt}, \frac{dG}{dt} \)

Alert system thresholds:
- High risk: \( IL > 0.7 \cdot IL_{max} \) or \( \Delta r_{LP} < -30\% \)
- Opportunity alert: \( \Delta P\% > 1.5 \cdot \tau \) or \( r_{LP} > 1.5 \cdot r_{LP,baseline} \)

Reporting frequency:
- Real-time metrics: Updated every minute
- Strategy performance: Daily summary
- Capital rebalancing: Weekly assessment

### Automated Execution

Automated system architecture:
1. **Price monitoring module**: Connected to multiple price oracles and exchange APIs
2. **Liquidity management module**: Handles adding, removing, and harvesting operations
3. **Arbitrage execution module**: Automatically executes trades when opportunities are detected
4. **Risk control module**: Implements stop-loss and risk control measures

Smart contract interactions:
```solidity
// Add liquidity
function addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint amountA, uint amountB, uint minA, uint minB) external;

// Remove liquidity
function removeLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint liquidity, uint minA, uint minB) external;

// Harvest rewards
function harvestRewards() external;

// Execute arbitrage
function executeArbitrage(address srcDex, address destDex, address token, uint amount) external;
```

Fail-safe mechanisms:
- Timeout handling: Automatically cancel and retry if transaction not confirmed after \( t > t_{timeout} \)
- Gas price adaptation: Based on \( G_{priority} = G_{base} \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot \text{congestion}) \)
- Failure fallback strategies: Define alternative execution paths after transaction failures

## Conclusion

The combined liquidity mining and arbitrage strategy represents a more complex but potentially higher-return approach. By simultaneously leveraging the liquidity mining rewards offered by DeFi protocols and the arbitrage opportunities that arise from liquidity fluctuations, this strategy can achieve more robust returns under various market conditions.

Compared to previous arbitrage strategies, the main advantages of this combined approach lie in the diversification of revenue sources and the improved capital utilization efficiency. Liquidity mining provides a baseline revenue stream, while arbitrage activities leverage the market insights and position advantages gained from participating in liquidity mining.

However, this strategy also introduces higher complexity and unique risks, particularly impermanent loss and protocol risks. Successfully implementing this strategy requires a carefully designed capital allocation framework, rigorous risk management system, and continuous monitoring and adaptation to market conditions.

By applying the mathematical framework outlined in this document, traders can systematically evaluate opportunities, optimize execution parameters, and manage specific risks. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve, the combined liquidity mining and arbitrage strategy will provide advanced traders with a valuable tool to gain a competitive edge in the ever-changing cryptocurrency markets.
